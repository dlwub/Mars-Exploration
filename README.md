# Mars-Exploration
Mars Exploration is a challenge taken from HackerRank and solved at a mob programming session of Microverse.
A space explorer's ship crashed on Mars! They send a series of SOS messages to Earth for help.
Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string,s, determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation.

Example
s= 'SOSTOT'
The original message was SOSSOS. Two of the message's characters were changed in transit.
